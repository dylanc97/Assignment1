Branches allows the user to jump from different versions of a file very quickly and efficiently

Branches also allows us to create and work on two different versions of the same file at the same time and merging both when completed.

(e)
git status looks at the entire repository and shows the changes that have been staged.

git log shows the history of the repository and single files to see when it was last updated.
git log also allows the user to search for specific changes done in the repository or a file.

Inheritance is when a child class copies the functions and member data of the parent class 

II
Polymorphism is when a function call does different things based on the object that calls it

III
Encapsulation is the bundling of data and functions into a class/struct

Dictator and lieutenants workflow allows for multiple branches to be pushed.
Integration managment only allows one person to push changes to the blessed repo.
(j)
The Centralized workflow would not work well with a large project and team because it only uses one branch.
Dictator and lieutenants workflow would work much better because it allows everyone working on the project to use their own branch
and merge later to complete it.

RoleGame OOP principles:

This project uses polymorphism as it is making seperate files that have seperate definitions of the same function for different classes
